This is a WPF .NET Core 3.1 application designed to browse images uploaded to [Prnt.sc](https://prnt.sc) using LightShot.

## Disclaimer

I developed the application to demonstrate why using sequential IDs may be dangerous, as well as to raise awareness - you should NOT upload any kind of sensitive data using LightShot or other services that use sequential IDs in links and don't require login and permissions to view content.

This application isn't an attack on LightShot - I use it myself, but copy or save image instead of uploading it. Uploading often is fine too - as long as the screenshot does not contain any sensitive information!

This application is developed for educational purposes, and I do not hold responsibility over any bans with LightShot/Prnt.sc service, or any troubles because information from screenshots was used for malicious purposes. Please, use your own brain when using this piece of software.
